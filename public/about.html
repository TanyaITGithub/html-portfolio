<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an IT support analyst whose big dream is to become a web developer. 
  I am doing this Bootcamp to learn how to code so that I can start my coding career at some point.</p>

<p>I am a keen language self-learner and coding itself reminds me of language syntax, therefore I've been really enjoying it so far.
  I hope this course will help me understand the basics of programming and motivate me to become an IT expert.

<p>I would like to use this project to present you two projects that I've recently created. 
  One represents a list of my favorite movies and the second one is my Birthday invitation.
I hope you'll like them!</p>
